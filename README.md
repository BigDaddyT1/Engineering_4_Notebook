###  Code 
This is a link to my code 
(https://github.com/BigDaddyT1/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Launch%20Pad.py)

### Reflection
 Although I didn't think I could code this project it was a good way to jump back into the school year. I learned what a pico was and how I could display something on the serial monitor. If I could go back and change anything I would say the while true loop is crucial I had no idea what it was and how to import it into my code. Overall It was a very fun and exiting project getting back into coding is something I really need and I am grateful that I'm back and I'm excited for all  the things to come this year  


## Launch Pad Part 2
### Assignment Description
The assignment is to create code to countdown from 10 to 1 and at 0 print "liftoff". In addition to using a breadboard, 2 LED lights one red and one green, 2 resistors to create the countdown. counting down from 10-1 with the red light and "liftoff green.

### Reflection
This project was very difficult getting back into the code was the easiest part. Everything else was a challenge uploading the photo and learning how to use the computer was hard. But in the end, I feel I can navigate through GitHub no and I can use the rasberry.py very well.

## Launch Pad Part 3

### Assignment Description
The assignment is to create code to countdown from 10 to 1 and at 0 print "liftoff". In addition to using a breadboard, 2 LED lights one red and one green, 2 resistors to create the countdown. counting down from 10-1 with the red light and "liftoff green. Moreover, use a button to start the process.

### Code

### Reflection
This project was very difficult in some aspects. adding the button was very hard because there were two types of buttons. I chose the breadboard button and it made things way less complicated in the long run. If i had to go back and fix anything I would tell people that coding to import a button can be very difficult if you try and import to much code. Keep things simple and add on little bits of code when needed. 

## Launch Pad Part 4

The assignment is to create code to countdown from 10 to 1 and at 0 print "liftoff". In addition to using a breadboard, 2 LED lights one red and one green, 2 resistors to create the countdown. counting down from 10-1 with the red light and "liftoff green. Moreover, use a button to start the process and with the button use the 180 servos to spin 180 degrees when the countdown says 0 and the 108 servo turns 180 degrees.

### Reflection

This project I would say is the most difficult of all 4 launchpad assignments. I was stuck on this assignment for at least 2 days and learning to try and connect the green LED with the 180 servo. If I could go back I would say the the while true loop is so important and hitting tap to put the code in a loop is very important. Commenting code has been very hard for me because AI had no Idea the meaning of the code but this assignment really helped me piece things togehter.  The documentation process was way faster and made everything run way smoother almost having it down to a tee.

## Crash Avoidance Part 1

### Assignment Description
 For this assignment, the goal is to Wire up an accelerometer that returns acceleration values for the x, y, and z axes to the serial monitor on the computer. " Mr Millar says the units should be in m/s2"

### Reflection
The Accelaromitor was very easy to learn the coding was very simple because I remembered the whole true loop. Coding is becoming easier and easier as the year progresses and using an accelerometer is fun. The hardest part of the project is getting the code to print out the ( X, Y, and Z) variables because I didn't fully read the directions. If I had to go back I would say read carefully and make sure everything is imported at the top of the code.


## Crash Avoidance Part2

### Assignment Description
For this assignment, the goal is to Wire up an accelerometer that returns acceleration values for the x, y, and z axes to the serial monitor on the computer in addition to that wire up an LED(Doesn't matter the color) and a battery pack to make the breadboard wireless. 

### Requirements (from MR.MIller)
-The module must have an accelerometer that continuously reports x, y, and z acceleration values.

-The module must have an LED that turns on if the helicopter is tilted to 90 degrees. 

-The module must be powered by a mobile power source.

### Reflection
This project was very fun to create and very simple because all I had to do was add on an LED( Mine was Blue) and then add on a power source to make the breadboard wireless. The hardest part of the assignment was finding a space to put the power source on the breadboard because I wanted to challenge myself and only use one breadboard. If I could go back and do one thing differently I would make my life easier and get the extra breadboard. Overall the project was very fun to create and making something wireless and being able to take it around class and show others how much I'm progressing is very fun. 
## Crash Avoidance Part 3

### Assignment Description 
For this assignment, the goal is to Wire up an accelerometer that returns acceleration values for the x, y, and z axes to the OLED screen on the breadboard in addition to that wire up an LED(Doesn't matter the color) and a battery pack to make the breadboard wireless. 

### Assignment Requirements(According To Mr. MIllers canvas page)
Assignment Requirements:
The module must have an accelerometer that continuously reports x, y, and z acceleration values.

The module must have an LED that turns on if the helicopter is tilted to 90 degrees. 

The module must be powered by a mobile power source. 

The module must have an onboard screen that prints x, y, and z angular velocity values (rad/s) rounded to 3 decimal places.

### Reflection
This assignment was very difficult in various ways because the coding was very hard. The hardest part of this assignment was the while true loop, not incorporating it to show on the OLED had me stumped for at least half an hour and it caused me so much trouble. In addition, making sure I had everything wired up was very difficult. Commenting as I went along made things calmer and slowed things down and helped me so much. If I could go back and change something I would make sure that when coding always use the while true loop and incorporate the OLED to make sure the OLED screen prints the values each second. Overall this project was very calming and very helpfull. 

## Beam Design #1 

### Assignment Description
working in teams of 1-2 people we are designing a 3D printed beam in Onshape with the goal of maximizing the weight the beam can hold before failure with a weight of 12.99 grams or less. with specific constrictions like no angles below 45 degrees or having any type of overhang/ underhang etc...

Automatic failures:
The beam breaks
The beam bends more than 35 mm

### Assignment Requirements(From Canvas):

- The beam must use the provided attachment block with no modifications

- The beam with the attachment block must be able to fully engage with the holder

- The beam must use the example eye bolt mounting geometry

- The center of the eyebolt hole must be 180 mm from the front face of the attachment block (in a direction perpendicular to the front face)

- No part of the beam may extend below the bottom face of the attachment block

- All vertical angles must be >= 45° measured relative to the horizontal plane (no overhangs)

- The beam must be PLA material

- The entire beam, including attachment block, must weight <= 13 grams

### Reflection
This project was very fun to create getting back into shape was very difficult but dusting off the rust with this project was fun. Learning how to use the bowlen tool was very helpful helped me use lins and get dimensions down way faster than I thought was possible. The hardest part of the project was cutting mass if there was anything I could change I would go back and build from the ground up instead of just randomly placing items in my project. Overall was a very engaging partner activity. 

## Beam Design #3

### Description
Run static finite element analyses on your beam to determine what areas need to be improved and if the design was completely trash redesign and improve.

### Reflection 
I worked with Cooper Morland and what we came up with was that right where the thickness of the beam ends is where it's most likely to snap. Ours had a lot of determination to not snap and that's what really matters. The good news is we can't do worse so improving it will be easy, we'll most likely give up width for our next design and add height all the way through so it's less likely to break under the 30 Newtons of force.


## Beam Design #4

### Description
Use data from FEA simulations to improve the maximum weight the beam can hold before meeting one of the two failure conditions. Remember, the two failure conditions are the beam breaking, or bending >=35 mm

### Reflection 
We improved our displacement by 3,149%. We completely redid our design, gave up width for height, and added a little bit of extra material at the bottom corners for support. Our new design is 12.86 grams with 13.3 mm of displacement. The stress map is mostly dark blue, if we had more time we could probably make improvements by adding support to all the corners at the base.

## Landing Area Part 1 (Functions)
### Assignment description
-Write a script that takes three coordinates and returns the area using a function on a monitor without the OLED screed. (import the coordinates then get the area.) 
### Assignment Requirements(From Canvas) From Mr. Miller:
Landing Area Part 1 Requirements:
- The code must ask for the user to input a set of three coordinates in (x,y) format

- The triangle area must be determined using a function

- If the user inputs coordinates incorrectly (letters or improper format) the code should return to the input stage, it should not throw an error or exit the script

- The triangle area must be printed to the screen in this format: “The area of the triangle with vertices (x,y), (x,y), (x,y) is {area} square km.

- The code must return to the input stage after printing the area, and wait for user input.

### Reflection
- This assignment was very difficult for me because the coding took very long. The hardest part of this assignment was the calculations for the area of the triangle and being able to do that was very essential for the project. If I could go back and change anything I would go back and make sure everything in the code made sense and that the sections of the code had proper lines of code( it would have saved me a lot of time). Overall the project was frustrating but well worth it in the end. 

## Landing Area Part 2 (Functions)
### Assignment description
-Write a script that takes three coordinates and returns the area using a function on a monitor with the use of an OLED screed. (import the coordinates then get the area.) and see the triangle on the OLED screen.

### Assignment Requirements(From Canvas) From Mr. Miller:
Landing Area Part 2 Requirements:

- The code must ask for the user to input a set of three coordinates in (x,y) format

- The triangle area must be determined using a function

- If the user inputs coordinates incorrectly (letters or improper format) the code should return to the input stage, it should not throw an error or exit the script

- The triangle area must be printed to the screen in this format: “The area of the triangle with vertices (x,y), (x,y), (x,y) is {area} square km.

- The code must return to the input stage after printing the area, and wait for user input.

- An onboard OLED screen must plot each triangle on a graph relative to the base location.

### Wiring Diagram 

### Reflection
- This assignment was very difficult for me because the coding took very long. The hardest part of this assignment was the calculations for the area of the triangle and being able to do that was very essential for the project. Being able to incorporate integers in my code was needed and I had a very difficult time finding that out. In addition to that I had a very hard time getting the actual OLED screen to turn on you have to wire everything up CORRECTLY. Overall was a very long and strenuous process. Very rewarding process in the end.
