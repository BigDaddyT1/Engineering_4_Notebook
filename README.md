## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

## Media Test

Your readme will have various images and gifs on it. Upload a test image and test gif to make sure you've got the process figured out. Pick whatever image and if you want!

## Launch Pad Part 2
### Assignment Description
The assignment is to create code to countdown from 10 to 1 and at 0 print "liftoff". In addition to using a breadboard, 2 LED lights one red and one green, 2 resistors to create the countdown. counting down from 10-1 with the red light and "liftoff green.

### Reflection
This project was very difficult getting back into the code was the easiest part. Everything else was a challenge uploading the photo and learning how to use the computer was hard. But in the end, I feel I can navigate through GitHub no and I can use the rasberry.py very well.

## Launch Pad Part 3
### Assignment Description
The assignment is to create code to countdown from 10 to 1 and at 0 print "liftoff". In addition to using a breadboard, 2 LED lights one red and one green, 2 resistors to create the countdown. counting down from 10-1 with the red light and "liftoff green. Moreover use a button to start the prosses.

### Reflection
This project was very easy and adding little parts of code made this project easy. The documentation process was way faster and made everything run way smoother.

## Launch Pad Part 4

The assignment is to create code to countdown from 10 to 1 and at 0 print "liftoff". In addition to using a breadboard, 2 LED lights one red and one green, 2 resistors to create the countdown. counting down from 10-1 with the red light and "liftoff green. Moreover, use a button to start the process and with the button use the 180 servos to spin 180 degrees when the countdown says 0 and the 108 servo turns 180 degrees.

### Reflection

This project was very easy adding the 180 servo was very simple and making it turn 180 degrees made this project easy. The documentation process was way faster and made everything run way smoother almost have it down to a tee.
