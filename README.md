## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

## Media Test

Your readme will have various images and gifs on it. Upload a test image and test gif to make sure you've got the process figured out. Pick whatever image and if you want!


## Launch Pad 1

### Assignment Description
create code that will Countdown from 10 seconds to 0 (liftoff). Print that countdown to the serial monitor.

### Materials 
What I used:
Breadboard 
Pico and USB cable.

### Reflection
 Although I didn't think I could code this project it was a good way to jump back into the school year. I learned what a pico was and how I could display something on the serial monitor. If I could go back and change anything I would say the while true loop is crucial I had no idea what it was and how to import it into my code. Overall It was a very fun and exiting project getting back into coding is something I really need and I am grateful that I'm back and I'm excited for all  the things to come this year  


## Launch Pad Part 2
### Assignment Description
The assignment is to create code to countdown from 10 to 1 and at 0 print "liftoff". In addition to using a breadboard, 2 LED lights one red and one green, 2 resistors to create the countdown. counting down from 10-1 with the red light and "liftoff green.

### Reflection
This project was very difficult getting back into the code was the easiest part. Everything else was a challenge uploading the photo and learning how to use the computer was hard. But in the end, I feel I can navigate through GitHub no and I can use the rasberry.py very well.

## Launch Pad Part 3

### Assignment Description
The assignment is to create code to countdown from 10 to 1 and at 0 print "liftoff". In addition to using a breadboard, 2 LED lights one red and one green, 2 resistors to create the countdown. counting down from 10-1 with the red light and "liftoff green. Moreover, use a button to start the process.

### Code

### Reflection
This project was very difficult in some aspects. adding the button was very hard because there were two types of buttons. I chose the breadboard button and it made things way less complicated in the long run. If i had to go back and fix anything I would tell people that coding to import a button can be very difficult if you try and import to much code. Keep things simple and add on little bits of code when needed. 

## Launch Pad Part 4

The assignment is to create code to countdown from 10 to 1 and at 0 print "liftoff". In addition to using a breadboard, 2 LED lights one red and one green, 2 resistors to create the countdown. counting down from 10-1 with the red light and "liftoff green. Moreover, use a button to start the process and with the button use the 180 servos to spin 180 degrees when the countdown says 0 and the 108 servo turns 180 degrees.

### Code

### Reflection

This project I would say is the most difficult of all 4 launchpad assignments. I was stuck on this assignment for at least 2 days and learning to try and connect the green LED with the 180 servo. If I could go back I would say the the while true loop is so important and hitting tap to put the code in a loop is very important. Commenting code has been very hard for me because AI had no Idea the meaning of the code but this assignment really helped me piece things togehter.  The documentation process was way faster and made everything run way smoother almost having it down to a tee.

## Crash Avoidance Part 1

### Assignment Description
 For this assignment, the goal is to Wire up an accelerometer that returns acceleration values for the x, y, and z axes to the serial monitor on the computer. " Mr Millar says the units should be in m/s2"

### Code

### Reflection
The Accelaromitor was very easy to learn the coding was very simple because I remembered the whole true loop. Coding is becoming easier and easier as the year progresses and using an accelerometer is fun. The hardest part of the project is getting the code to print out the ( X, Y, and Z) variables because I didn't fully read the directions. If I had to go back I would say read carefully and make sure everything is imported at the top of the code.
